### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This repository contains code and analysis supporting my research on computational modeling of arthritis-related disease dynamics.

### AUTHORSHIP
All code and analysis in this repository were developed by me in support of the associated conference poster and preprint.

### PROJECT STATUS
This repository represents an active research project and reflects an ongoing, exploratory workflow rather than a finalized software release. The codebase is organized to support iterative development, analysis, and visualization of results.

### REPOSITORY CONTENTS
- **Simulation & Result Generation** (Java)
- **Datasets & Intermediate Outputs** (CSV)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** (Jupyter Notebook, Python)
- **Figures & Generated Graphs** (PNG)
